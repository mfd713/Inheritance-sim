# Inheritance-sim

## Summary
This project was inspired by the [Sims 4 Legacy Challenge](https://simslegacychallenge.com/the-sims-4-legacy-challenge-rules/). Its main purpose is to generate a child of two sims that will have 3 semi-randomly, semi-genetically generated traits. These traits can have a dominant, recessive, or mixed genotype, whcih will affect their likelihood of being passed on. In the majority of cases, the child will share at least one trait from at least one parent.

## Quickstart
1. Open up main.html
1. Use the dropdown menu to choose traits for each parent.
1. *Optional:* use the buttons next to each trait to assign its genotype
1. Click "Generate Child"
1. The child's traits and genotype will appear in the space below the button.
